<h2>Detection and Classification on Ionospheric Scintillation and Interference by Using a Machine Learning Algorithm</h2>
<p><i>Supervised by Prof. Jade Morton and collaborated with Dr. Yu Jiao</i></p>
<p>In this work, we propose to use a machine learning algorithm called random forest to simultaneously detect and classify  scintillation and interference. Compared to conventional scintillation detection methods, the proposed method is capable of classifying an additional category: interference. The features containing both time and frequency domain information present the best performance, reaching an accuracy of 97%. The results also show that the proposed method outperforms other machine learning algorithms.</p>
<h2>Automatic Detection of Ionospheric Scintillation-like GNSS Satellite Oscillator Anomaly Using a Machine Learning Algorithm</h2>
<p><i>Supervised by Prof. Jade Morton</i></p>
<p>In this work, we propose a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect satellite oscillator anomaly. A major challenge is to differentiate an oscillator anomaly from ionospheric scintillation. Although both scintillation and oscillator anomalies cause phase disturbances, their underlying physics are different and, therefore, show different carrier frequency dependency. By using triple-frequency signals, distinct features are extracted from the disturbed signals and applied to the radial basis function (RBF) support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify an oscillator anomaly. The results show that the proposed RBF SVM displays superior performance and outperforms several other classification methods. The proposed approach is applied on a database to conduct automatic satellite oscillator anomaly detection. Preliminary detection results show that there are on average 1.7 and 0.2 anomaly events observed on PRN1 and PRN25 each day, respectively. </p>

<h2>Application of Neural Network to GNSS-R Wind Speed Retrieval</h2>
<p><i>Supervised by Prof. Jade Morton and collaborated with Ian Collett</i></p>
<p>This work applies a machine learning algorithm based on the multi-hidden layer neural network (MHL-NN) for ocean surface wind speed estimation using GNSS reflection measurements. Unlike conventional wind speed retrieval methods which often depend on limited scalar delay-Doppler map (DDM) observables, the proposed MHL-NN makes use of information captured by the entire DDM. Both simulated and real datasets are used to train and evaluate the performance of the MHL-NN and compare it to a conventional wind speed retrieval method and other prevailing machine learning algorithms. The results show that the MHL-NN algorithm outperforms the other methods in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the wind speed estimation.</p>

<h2>Application of machine learning to the characterization of GPS L1 ionospheric amplitude scintillation</h2>
<p><i>Supervised by Prof. Jade Morton and collaborated with Dr. Yu Jiao</i></p>
<p>Ionospheric scintillation refers to the rapid fluctuation of the amplitude and phase of radio-frequency signals, such as GNSS, propagating through the ionosphere. Strong scintillation can severely impact signal acquisition and tracking in a GNSS receiver, resulting in a performance degradation in accuracy and continuity. Therefore, a thorough understanding of ionospheric scintillation effects on GNSS signals has drawn much attention in both the scientific fields and industry. Previously, the scintillation events were manually identified by human experts, which hampers the possibility of conducting a large batch processing. In this paper, we first implement an improved machine learning algorithm to automatically detect scintillation events. We also show that the improved version outperforms the previous implementation. Then we apply the trained machine learning algorithms to a large database of GPS L1C/A data collected in equatorial and high latitude areas to detect amplitude scintillation. Finally, the statistical characterisation of the detected amplitude scintillation is presented and discussed.</p>

<h2>Oversampled Frequency Domain MMSE Equalization for SC-FDMA Communication in Non-Ideal Wireless Channels</h2>
<p><i>Supervised by Prof. Yong Liang Guan and Prof. Gang Wu</i></p>
<p>Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) is an alternative technique which also benefits low signal processing  complexity for multi-path fading, comparing with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA). </p>
<p>However, it also suffers greatly from carrier frequency offset (CFO) due to that CFO  destroys the orthogonality among subcarriers. Therefore, BER performance severely degrades by such channel effect. </p>
<p>Based on frequency domain oversampling and the Bayesian Gauss-Markov theorem, we propose a novel frequency domain oversampling MMSE equalization receiver for SC-FDMA system. Frequency domain oversampling MMSE equalizer greatly improves the BER performance in highly frequency selective channel with or without CFO effect by extracting frequency diversity. As number of channel path drops down to 1, oversampling scheme degenerates to conventional scheme due to there is no frequency diversity. In addition, it is shown that oversampling factor could be no larger than (N-Q+1)/N, where N is the subcarrier number and Q is the number of channel path components.  </p>

<h2>USRP-based OFDM Indoor Radar for Doorway Detection</h2>
<p><i>Supervised by Prof. Yong Liang Guan and Prof. Dmitriy Garmatyuk</i></p>
<p>Radar is an object-detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range and direction of objects. It could be employed on an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for autonomous navigation. Although the UGV could sense the surrounding environment by using optical sensors such as camera or infrared sensors, these sensors may not work well in some environments, such as an environment with low visibility or an environment with obstacles made of transparent or polished materials. In these cases, radar sensors could be employed along with these optical sensors to enhance the navigation capability of an UGV.</p>
<p>To investigate this, a low-cost narrowband radar system based on USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) hardware and C<tt></tt>/MATLAB programming is implemented to enable UGV autonomous indoor navigation. The main purpose is to investigate open doorway detection in an indoor environment utilizing a narrowband radar, which could be used for the UGV to detect the open doorway and navigate itself autonomously through the doorway.</p>
<p>We first present the design and calibration of a power-based narrowband radar system. It was found that, when the radar faces the wall, the relation between the received power and the distance to the wall follows the free-space path loss equation, rather than the traditional radar equation. This is due to the fact that the wall is too large to be treated as a point scatterer, and is better approximated by an infinite reflecting surface. We also present the design and validation of radar ranging. The radar ranging algorithm was verified in three conditions, 1) using cables (to avoid multipath and self-interference problems), 2) in an anechoic chamber (to avoid multipath) and 3) in a real indoor environment. The test results show that the ranging error is approximately 50cm and the maximum detection range is up to 6 meters.</p>
<p>To detect an open doorway with an UGV, a ”2-step” doorway detection proce- dure is utilized in this thesis. In the first step (“Step 1”), the nearest wall is detected by using a detection method called Shortest Range Determination (SRD). Then, in the second step (“Step 2”), an open doorway is detected by using the radar and a power-based detection algorithm to scan the space parallel to the nearest wall detected in the first step. This detection algorithm is based on total variation de-noising. It detects an open doorway by detecting the cross-range of the posi- tions of the leftmost and rightmost sides of the open doorway. The experimental results give a detection error of around 30cm. Furthermore, when the robot scans the wall in “Step 2”, the range between the wall and the radar can be measured by using radar ranging process. By averaging all the reliable ranging values, the range between the robot and the wall is estimated to provide extra information of the doorway position. The doorway position coordinate is then built up by com- bining these information including the cross-range and the range of the doorway positions. Our approach to radar-assisted indoor positioning of an UGV is thus validated. Future research on this topic may include exploration of more complex scenarios (e.g. detection of signs of life amid rubble for UGV-based search-and- rescue missions), as well as enhancing the capabilities of the USRP-based system by fusing sensing and communications.</p>
