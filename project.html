<h2><a href="scfdmaproject.html">Oversampled Frequency Domain MMSE Equalization for SC-FDMA Communication in Non-Ideal Wireless Channels</a></h2>
<p><i>Supervised by Prof. GUAN YONG LIANG and Prof. Gang Wu</i></p>
<p>Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) is an alternative technique which also benefits low signal processing  complexity for multi-path fading, comparing with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA). </p>
<p>However, it also suffers greatly from carrier frequency offset (CFO) due to that CFO  destroys the orthogonality among subcarriers. Therefore, BER performance severely degrades by such channel effect. </p>
<p>Based on frequency domain oversampling and the Bayesian Gauss-Markov theorem, we propose a novel frequency domain oversampling MMSE equalization receiver for SC-FDMA system. Frequency domain oversampling MMSE equalizer greatly improves the BER performance in highly frequency selective channel with or without CFO effect by extracting frequency diversity. As number of channel path drops down to 1, oversampling scheme degenerates to conventional scheme due to there is no frequency diversity. In addition, it is shown that oversampling factor could be no larger than (N-Q+1)/N, where N is the subcarrier number and Q is the number of channel path components.  </p>

<h2><a href="scfdmaproject.html">USRP-based OFDM Indoor Radar for Doorway Detection</a></h2>
<p><i>Supervised by Prof. GUAN YONG LIANG and Prof. Dmitriy Garmatyuk</i></p>
<p>With an advent of high-speed digital converters and processors a new application of microwave technology has emerged: software-defined, multi-functional systems. One such new development is re-use of the same waveform for both radar and communications thus providing for simultaneous operations of communication and sensing. An obvious advantage of this approach is much more effective use of spectral resources when both functionalities need to be present. We propose to apply this approach to indoor mapping with communication-like signaling: specifically, in our current work we perform doorway detection with OFDM waveforms in the unknown environment. The low cost software design radio USRP is implemented as the front end while signal is processed in computer. We use the reflection power comparison detection method and ranging detection method to distinguish the difference between wall and doorway. With the dynamic spectrum assignment and fusion properties of OFDM system the utilized signals can be used not only for sensing, but also for broadcasting the mapping information to nearby systems.</p>
